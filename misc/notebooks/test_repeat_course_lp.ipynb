With the recent emphasis on the adverse impact of carbon emissions from data centers, there is renewed interest from industry, government, and  acaemia in making computing more sustainable. This seminar course will cover recent advances in this space. Specifically, we will first discuss the nature of the problem and the cost of unsustainable data center operations, especially for Al workloads. We will then discuss factors that contribute to unsustainable operations in data centers and computing broadly, including operational and embedded carbon. The remaining of the course will focus on defining the problem, the metrics of sustainability in computing, and possible approaches to stem unsustainable computing in data centers, including  space-and time-scheduling of workloads to better leverage clean energy, lowering the compute demand of workloads, and harnessing latest hardware advances to reduce embodied carbon in computing.\\n\\nThis 1-credit seminar course will cover topics in computation sustainability, including (but not limited to):\\n- definition of computational sustainability, including components and metrics of sustainability used in research and practice\\n- current state of computational sustainability in data centers and for specific workloads, such as Al and ML training\\n- unsustainable practices in data centers and computing and reasons behind them\\n- survey of proposed solutions in literature and discussion\\n\\nStudents enrolling for the seminar will be expected to lead at least 2 weekly meetings by summarizing recent papers on computational sustainability, and to participate in all meeting discussions.',\n",
