For example, we will examine ways to define successful and maladaptive coping. We will also consider whether social support is better conceptualized as a commodity or as an individual perception.

Starting with the philosophy of the mind and the history of neuroscience, the course proceeds with an introduction of cells, neural signaling, transmitters and receptors. How these elemental units are integrated to support emergent properties, usch as object recognition, is illustrated. Coversely, examples of complex behavioral impairments resulting from dysfunction in elemental units illustrated. The course proceed to cover neral metabolism, and its relation to disorders of memory and motor dysfunction. Last, stress and its role in neuropsychological disorders is discussed.\nSpring, 3 credits, ABCF grading",
