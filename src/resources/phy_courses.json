For a long time accelerator physics courses have been taught as \"PHY 584: Special Topics in Nuclear Physics\", but this is improper use of the course listing. The purpose of this course is two-fold. First, it is a special topic course that is taught full time at Stony Brook. Second, it is special topics course which is taught in collaboration with the United States Particle Accelerator School (USPAS), which is taught on a rotating basis at various universities and National Laboratories in the US. If that is the case, students will prepare for the USPAS course during the semester, and will particioate in the USPAS school in the following Winter or Summer break. The grade for the course will be determined by the grade in the USPAS school. Funding to participate in the USPAS course will be provided by USPAS if students are registered for such course at their local university.",

The principal deleterious effects taking place at high power levels are caused by arcing (a high peak power effect) and the ohmic dissipation in the metal walls (a high average power effect). Exceeding the power handling capacity of the RF components can result in expensive repairs. Methods of mitigating or avoiding these expensive repairs are discussed. Important applications of high power rf are discussed in depth. Finally the students are given an extended project on implementing a particle accelerator using the traditional method of placing cylindrical cavities in tandem and using the longitudinal electric field in the TM010 cavity mode to pump RF power into a particle beam and cause the desired acceleration of the charge particles.",
