Major equipment include lighting, air circulation system, cooling and heating equipment, solar thermal panels and solar PV panels, and other equipment including integrated electric and control units. Of the comfort requirements only temperature-and-humidity and illumination are studied with the objective of creating, through a system-understanding of the building, buildings that in the short run meet these requirements involving minimal use of energy and in the long run are benchmarked against the environmentally regenerative capabilities of wilderness.\n\nOffered in Spring, 3 credits, ABCF Grading",

It will be shown that in the language of projective geometry, one can design curves, surface, and motions utilizing same algorithms and similar data structures. In the process, the students will learn the theory of NURBS (Non- Uniform Rational B-splines), which is the standard representation in existing CAD\/CAM system, and extend it to the space of rigid body displacements for the design of motions. Students will implement shape and motion design algorithms in graphical computer programs.",
