The foundational sciences include: biomaterials, biological processes including cell biology and physiology, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, stem cell differentiation, growth factors, and tissue\/organ development. An overarching core principle is\nengineering design. The course will be divided into 3 modules: Discovery and validation, Transition from laboratory prototype to fixed prototype, Progression through clinical trials. Although scale-up manufacturing and commercialization will be discussed, these final steps to the market-place will not be covered in detail. Students will work in teams. Each team will\nselect a TERM project with a specific type of bench to bedside pathway (team size will depend on the class size). However, other BME areas may be included, e.g. microelectron-mechanical systems (MEMS), can be designed to stimulate muscle, thus avoid atrophy while awaiting a TERM construct. For such projects, the team should choose an appropriate BME faculty advisor to guide them.

The material is oriented to cover basic and state of the art concepts in space radiation environment, physics and radiobiology. Content includes basic concepts in physics, dosimetry, radiobiology, space radiation problems and accelerator operations. Concurrent sessions are provided to complete specific BNL training and plan and prepare experiments for low- and high-LET radiation exposures. Students are trained in NSRL operations and are able to run control experiments using gamma rays in preparation for NSRL runs, and subsequently experiments at the NSRL using heavy ions. Data are obtained from different endpoints are discussed and analyzed with the instructors. Homework are used to test the student's level of comprehension of the lectures and laboratory activities. The write up of a full BNL beam time request proposal is required of each student.",
