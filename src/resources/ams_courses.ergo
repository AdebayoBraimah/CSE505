Traditional data processing and analysis techniques are no longer adequate -- they have to be revised and customized to parallel computing paradigms, at the same time, modern data mining tools are being created and evolved, at their own fast pace, to accommodate the analysis of various big data problems.  This course is subsequently created to enable the timely education of a new generation of competent data analysts.

This course introduces the application of the supercomputing to statistical data analyses, particularly on big data. Implementations of various statistical methodologies within parallel computing framework are demonstrated through all lectures. The course will cover (1) parallel computing basics, including architecture on interconnection networks, communications methodologies, algorithm and performance measurements, and (2) their applications to modern data mining techniques, including modern variable selection/Dimension reduction, linear/logistical regression, tree-based classification methods, Kernel-based methods, non-linear statistical models, and model inference/Resampling methods.
