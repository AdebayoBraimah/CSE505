Through discussion and analysis of engineering disasters from nuclear meltdowns to stock market crashes to climate-driven catastrophes, this course will focus on how modern engineers learn from their mistakes in order to create designs that decrease the chance and severity of failure. The impact of engineers' values and ethics, as well as the crucial role of diversity and inclusiveness on successful engineering design, will be discussed in detail.",
