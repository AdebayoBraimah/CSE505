PHY689,Special Topics in Accelerator Physics,Graduate,1.00 - 3.00,NONE,NONE,NONE,"Recently we established the Center for Accelerator Physics with Vladimir Litvinenko appointed as Director (with a shared appointment at BNL), and with a second faculty position in accelerator physics being added in the near future, we expect that the number of students working on accelerator physics will increase significantly and there will be much more demand for courses in this area. For a long time accelerator physics courses have been taught as ""PHY 584: Special Topics in Nuclear Physics"", but this is improper use of the course listing. The purpose of this course is two-fold. First, it is a special topic course that is taught full time at Stony Brook. Second, it is special topics course which is taught in collaboration with the United States Particle Accelerator School (USPAS), which is taught on a rotating basis at various universities and National Laboratories in the US. If that is the case, students will prepare for the USPAS course during the semester, and will particioate in the USPAS school in the following Winter or Summer break. The grade for the course will be determined by the grade in the USPAS school. Funding to participate in the USPAS course will be provided by USPAS if students are registered for such course at their local university.",1,1

PHY693,High Power RF Engineering,Graduate,1.00 - 3.00,NONE,NONE,NONE,"The course starts with an essential review of the properties of low and medium power RF waves and components including transmission lines, waveguides and cavities, and then proceeds to highlight the properties and limitations under high power RF conditions. The principal deleterious effects taking place at high power levels are caused by arcing (a high peak power effect) and the ohmic dissipation in the metal walls (a high average power effect). Exceeding the power handling capacity of the RF components can result in expensive repairs. Methods of mitigating or avoiding these expensive repairs are discussed. Important applications of high power rf are discussed in depth. Finally the students are given an extended project on implementing a particle accelerator using the traditional method of placing cylindrical cavities in tandem and using the longitudinal electric field in the TM010 cavity mode to pump RF power into a particle beam and cause the desired acceleration of the charge particles.",1,1
