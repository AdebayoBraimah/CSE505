After a brief review of VLSI design methodologies and current IC trends, fundamental challenges related to the conventional CMOS technologies are described. The shift from logic-centric to interconnect-centric design is emphasized. Primary aspects of an interconnect-centric design flow are described in four phases: (1) general characteristics of on-chip interconnects, (2) on-chip interconnects for data signals, (3) on-chip power generation and distribution, and (4) on-chip clock generation and distribution. Existing design challenges faced by IC industry are investigated for each phase. Tradeoffs among various design criteria such as speed-power-noise-area are highlighted. In the last phase of the course, several post-CMOS devices, emerging circuit styles, and architectures are briefly discussed. At the end of the course, the students will have a thorough understanding of the primary circuit and physical level design challenges with application to industrial IC design.\nPrerequisites: ESE555 or ESE330 and ESE 355\nSpring, 3 Credits, ABCF Grading",

The principal deleterious effects taking place at high power levels are caused by arcing (a high peak power effect) and the ohmic dissipation in the metal walls (a high average power effect). Exceeding the power handling capacity of the RF components can result in expensive repairs. Methods of mitigating or avoiding these expensive repairs are discussed. Important applications of high power rf are discussed in depth. Finally the students are given an extended project on implementing a particle accelerator using the traditional method of placing cylindrical cavities in tandem and using the longitudinal electric field in the TM010 cavity mode to pump RF power into a particle beam and cause the desired acceleration of the charge particles.",
