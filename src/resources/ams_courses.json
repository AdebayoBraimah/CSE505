Different censoring mechanisms will be discussed. The course will mainly cover Kaplan-Meier estimator for characterizing the distribution of the failure and survival data, non-parametric log-rank test for comparing multiple groups, and the accelerated failure time model and Cox regression model uncovering various predictor\/explanatory variables to survival\/failure. Applications to finance, economics and biomedicine will be illustrated.\nWe have revised the course title and content to better suit our current graduate programs in Applied Mathematics and Statistics that have evolved substantially from our old forms. In our current program, students from many tracks, especially in statistics and in quantitative finance, need this updated course as a highly relevant and important elective. This same subject is generally referred to as `Survival data analysis\u00bf in biostatistics, but `Failure data analysis\u00bf in finance.  This updated title will reflect the content of the course clearly for students from all tracks.",

Traditional data processing and analysis techniques are no longer adequate -- they have to be revised and customized to parallel computing paradigms, at the same time, modern data mining tools are being created and evolved, at their own fast pace, to accommodate the analysis of various big data problems.  This course is subsequently created to enable the timely education of a new generation of competent data analysts.\n\nThis course introduces the application of the supercomputing to statistical data analyses, particularly on big data. Implementations of various statistical methodologies within parallel computing framework are demonstrated through all lectures. The course will cover (1) parallel computing basics, including architecture on interconnection networks, communications methodologies, algorithm and performance measurements, and (2) their applications to modern data mining techniques, including modern variable selection\/Dimension reduction, linear\/logistical regression, tree-based classification methods, Kernel-based methods, non-linear statistical models, and model inference\/Resampling methods.\n\nPrerequisites: AMS 572, AMS 573 and AMS 578\n\nFall, 3 Credits, ABCF Grading",
