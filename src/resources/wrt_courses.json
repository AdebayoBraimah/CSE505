In consultation with the instructor, each student works for the entire semester on applying for a real grant that is external to Stony Brook University. Key subjects to be taught include understanding funders and funding opportunities, researching and locating one's position in the disciplinary field of the grant, articulating relevant problems in that field, specifying appropriate and evidence-based solutions, addressing specific audiences, and utilizing rhetorical appeals. In addition to frequent low-stakes writing tasks, the course requires three high-stakes written projects: a literature review, a research proposal, and a grant application along with an abstract.",

Building on the understanding that writing is a recursive process (a cycle of planning, drafting, revising, and editing), students also learn to analyze and problem-solve issues that become barriers for effective writing and communication.",
