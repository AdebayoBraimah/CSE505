Longitudinal data analysis allows one to study the changes in mean response over time and answer other scientific questions pertaining to the relationship between the response and time.  This course aims to introduce statistical models and methods for the analysis of longitudinal data.  Both the classical (univariate and multivariate repeated analysis of variance) and more recent approaches (1) general linear models for correlation, random coefficient models, linear mixed effect models for normal repeated measurements; (2) generalized linear models for non-normal response and population-averaged models (generalized estimating equations) for non-normal repeated measurements, of analyzing longitudinal data will be covered in this course.

This course is subsequently created to enable the timely education of a new generation of competent data analysts.

This course introduces the application of the supercomputing to statistical data analyses, particularly on big data. Implementations of various statistical methodologies within parallel computing framework are demonstrated through all lectures. The course will cover (1) parallel computing basics, including architecture on interconnection networks, communications methodologies, algorithm and performance measurements, and (2) their applications to modern data mining techniques, including modern variable selection/Dimension reduction, linear/logistical regression, tree-based classification methods, Kernel-based methods, non-linear statistical models, and model inference/Resampling methods.
